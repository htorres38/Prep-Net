## Architecture

Progress data (lesson completions, lab scores, notes, streaks) is written to Neon via a server-side API route and synced to the client through PowerSync's local SQLite layer. The offline capabilites are in progress however — End goal = state is stored locally first and synced when connectivity is available.

The AI tutor has full context of the current lesson and slide, enabling targeted answers rather than generic responses.
